<h3 id="why">Why</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It feels like such a luxury to have a pool.</li>
  <li>Swimming in the summer is really nice, the whole family enjoys it.</li>
  <li>We currently have one of those set-up pools. This has no isolation and needs a ton of maintenance to keep the water clean.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>For a 6x4x1.5m pool, you will need 36m続 of water. For pools of 40m続 a pump of 10m続/h is suggested. We are overdoing it with the 14m続/h pump, because we also want to push the water through either heating mats or some other construction on the roof.</p>

<p>When using a polystyreen pool, you build the frame of the pool of the isolation material. You build this on top of a concrete floor.</p>
