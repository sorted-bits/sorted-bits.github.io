<h3 id="why">Why</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Open source</li>
  <li>Easy to automate certain tasks, set time limits on lights, etc.</li>
  <li>Ability to add my own integrations when certain hardware isnâ€™t supported</li>
  <li>Easy to monitor sensors in the house</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Next to a <a href="/tech/home-automation">home automation</a> system, I also want to use  to tie stuff together. Currently I use Home Assistant to turn lights on and off based on time of day, light levels in house and certain schedules. Next to that I use it to log data about our current house, like electricity and gas usages.</p>

<p>Because HA is really easy to extend with new modules and the community is really alive, I plan to use it to make certain things work which each other.</p>

<p>Things I see where Home Assistant could be really useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monitor output of solar panels to see if (for example) a car should be charged.</li>
  <li>Give the car charger a command to actually charge a car.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the challenges is to keep the house operating while Home Assistant goes down (or is under maintenance). This is one of the things that really brings down reliability.</p>
