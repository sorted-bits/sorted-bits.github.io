<h3 id="why">Why</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In the end both cars will be replaced with electric cars</li>
  <li>Charging cars with solar panels makes sure we have zero output while driving the car</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>As we are slowly transitioning from ICE to electric cars. While it is smart to be prepared for that, it might not be needed to install two chargers immediately.</p>

<p>Currently I am using a <a href="https://www.besen-group.com/ev-charging-station/ev-charging-station-wall/1-3-phase-ev-charging-station-app-control.html">Besen Wallbox</a> charger which can be monitored and controlled from an app.</p>

<p>For Home Assistant to be able to control it, I need to figure out the network commands it is sending, so I sent a request to the company that created it, to see if any API documentation is available.</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>When charging a car from home you are limited by your <a href="/references/breaker-size/">breaker size</a> and of course the maximum capacity of your charger itself.</p>

<p>In the cost calculation below we are using a 3x35A connection, so we can charge cars with a maximum of 22kW.</p>
